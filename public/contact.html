<h4>With your small bumbum😏🥰 well here’s a place I wouldn't trade for the world - your heart. ❤️🔐
  <p></p>

  I must say, darling, it's the most beautiful jail I've ever known. It's filled with warmth, love, and the sweetest of memories. Each beat feels like a soothing lullaby, bringing me peace, comfort, and a happiness that words can't describe. 😌🎶
  <p></p>
  
  Oh, and the jailer? She's the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. Her smile is my sunshine, her laughter my favorite melody. You, my love, are the only reason I'm a happy prisoner. 💃🌞
  <p></p>
  
  I promise you, My Beautiful Onyinye, as long as I'm in this beautiful jail, I vow to cherish it, to love it, to protect it. I promise to fill it with laughter, joy, and endless love. Because your heart, my darling, is my paradise, my forever home. 💖🏡
  <p></p>
  
  And you, my love, you are my everything. The air I breathe, the song in my heart, the dreams in my eyes. I love you, more than yesterday, less than tomorrow, but always, forever and a day. 💘💌 
  <p></p>
  
  So here's to our love, my beautiful jailer. Here's to a lifetime of stolen kisses, shared smiles and endless love. Here's to us, my love, forever and always. 😘🥂
  <p></p>
  
  
  P.S. Lock me up, throw away the key, my love. I wouldn't have it any other way! 😉💋
<p></p>
